                The All On Four concept means that the bridge that compensates
                all teeth of one jaw leans on only 4 implants. All On Four is a
                safe and predictable procedure, with an extremely high success
                rate.<br/><br/>If you want to walk in the dental clinic in the morning,
                leave all the troubles youâ€™ve been having with your teeth
                behind, and walk out in the afternoon with beautiful, fixated
                teeth, call us and schedule the first check-up. * in certain
                cases, it takes up to 48h to make temporary work.
